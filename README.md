Due to the mortality and disabilities caused by ischemic stroke, it is of great significance to provide accurate segmentation during the treatment of ischemic stroke. In this study, pre-trained UNets were utilized to save the computational resource and provide accurate prediction of lesion area caused by ischemic stroke. More specifically, this study proposed four ImageNet-based pre-trained models as encoders for constructing UNets, which aim at applying non-medical priori knowledge to improve the efficiency and performance of each neural network. Additionally a self-defined UNet was built as a baseline. All five models were trained on the ATLAS 2.0 dataset after a data filter and binary focal loss were used to mitigate the data imbalance. Finally, trainable parameters, training time and segmentation results from all five models were used for comparison.  Experimental results indicate that pre-trained models achieve a recall rate of approximately 0.95 on average and consume only half of the time that self-defined UNet costs. Briefly, pre-trained models achieve a competitive performance than that of the self-defined UNet and can deliver accurate segmentation results for patients suffering from ischemic stroke.
